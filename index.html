          <p class="text-secondary ms-3 pb-3 pt-3 mb-0 " style="width:fit-content;">Yuvan Shankar Raja was born on <span class="text-white">31 August 1979</span>. He is the third and youngest child of <span class="text-white"> musician and film composer Ilaiyaraaja </span>. He is the younger brother of <span class="text-white"> music director Karthik Raja </span> and <span class="text-white"> playback singer-music director Bhavatharini </span>. Yuvan once confessed that his brother Karthik Raja was more talented than him, 
            but he did not get a successful break into the music business since he did not get a "good team to work with". His father as well as his siblings have sung many songs under his direction. Film director and film composer <span class="text-white"> Gangai Amaran </span> and R. D. Bhaskar are his uncles and their sons <span class="text-white"> Venkat Prabhu, Premgi Amaren </span> and Parthi Bhaskar, who are working in the <span class="text-white"> Tamil film industry </span> as well, are his cousins.
            Yuvan Shankar did his schooling at <span class="text-white"> St. Bede's Anglo Indian Higher Secondary School </span> in Chennai, and discontinued his education after his tenth class. He started learning music from <span class="text-white"> Jacob Master </span>,attending piano classes at <span class="text-white"> "Musee Musical" </span> in Chennai, which is affiliated to <span class="text-white"> Trinity College </span> in London, UK.
            Yuvan Shankar Raja stated that he always wanted to become a pilot and travel "all around the world", but as he grew up "with music around him", he eventually became a musician. He admires the work of his father and other composers such as <span class="text-white"> S. D. Burman, R. D. Burman, M. S. Viswanathan </span> and <span class="text-white"> Naushad Ali </span> and the voices of singers <span class="text-white"> Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhosle, P. B. Sreenivas, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam </span>, and <span class="text-white"> P. Susheela </span>.<br>
            Within a span of <span class="text-white"> 25 years </span>, Yuvan has worked on over <span class="text-white"> 170 films </span>. Being the youngest son of composer <span class="text-white"> Ilaiyaraaja </span>, he began his <span class="text-white"> musical career in 1996 </span>, at the age of 16, when he composed the film score for <span class="text-white"> Aravindhan </span>. He got his breakthrough with the <span class="text-white"> Thulluvadho Ilamai (2002) </span> soundtrack, and established himself as one of Tamil cinema's most sought-after composers by the mid-2000s. He won the <span class="text-white"> Filmfare Award </span> for Best Music Director – Tamil in 2004 for his score in the drama <span class="text-white"> 7G Rainbow Colony </span>. In 2006, he became the only <span class="text-white"> Indian composer </span> to win the <span class="text-white"> Cyprus International Film Festival Award </span> for the soundtrack of <span class="text-white"> Raam </span>. He also won the <span class="text-white"> Filmfare Special Award </span> – South in 2009 for his Telugu musical <span class="text-white"> Oy! </span>.

          <h3 class="ps-2" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color: rgb(76, 150, 190);font-weight: 500;">Film score and soundtracks</h3>
          <h4 class="ps-2"  style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color: rgb(76, 150, 190);font-weight: 400;">Early years (1997–2000)</h4>
          <p class="text-secondary ps-4">In 1996, following his mother's suggestion to take up music <span class="text-white"> as a profession </span>, Yuvan Shankar Raja started composing tunes for an album.<span class="text-white"> T. Siva </span>, the producer of the Tamil language film <span class="text-white"> Aravindhan </span>, after hearing some of the tunes, asked him to compose a trailer music score. As Siva was impressed by the music, he gave Yuvan Shankar the assignment to compose the entire film score, including a soundtrack for that film. After consulting and getting consent from his parents, he accepted the offer; his music career started. His entry into the Tamil film and music industry had happened <span class="text-white"> at age 16 </span>, thus he became one of the youngest composers ever in the industry, which he says, was <span class="text-white"> "purely accidental".</span><br>
            However, both the soundtrack album as well as the film itself failed to attract audiences and do well, and Yuvan Shankar Raja's following projects Velai (1998) and <span class="text-white"> Kalyana Galatta </span> (1998) were not successful either; his compositions for these films did not receive good reviews or responses, with one reviewer labelling the music and background score in the latter as "cacophony" and "poor". The failures of his first projects meant that he was not offered any film projects and assignments subsequently. During this time of struggle, he was approached and assigned by director Vasanth to compose the music for his film <span class="text-white"> Poovellam Kettuppar (1999) </span>. The soundtrack received a very positive response, being described as "fresh" and "different", with a critic from <span class="text-white"> The New Indian Express </span> citing that his "absolutely enchanting musical score bears testimony to his "Raja" surname." The album became very popular, particularly songs such as "Irava Pagala" and "Chudithar Aninthu", gaining him first time notice, especially among young people and children. The album would make possible his first breakthrough in the industry and proved to be a major turning point in his career. After working for two <span class="text-white"> Sundar C </span>. films, <span class="text-white"> Unakkaga Ellam Unakkaga </span> (1999) and <span class="text-white"> Rishi </span> (2000), he got to work for <span class="text-white"> A. R. Murugadoss's </span> directorial debut in 2000, the action flick <span class="text-white"> Dheena </span>, starring Ajith Kumar, which went on to become a blockbuster and Yuvan Shankar Raja's first major successful film. Yuvan Shankar's songs were equally successful, which are considered to have played a major role in the film's great success, while his <span class="text-white"> background score </span> in the film was also well appreciated.</p>
          <h4 class="ps-2"  style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color: rgb(76, 150, 190);font-weight: 400;">Peak Success (2004–2007)</h4>
          <p class="text-secondary ps-4">Yuvan Shankar's <span class="text-white"> 2004 </span> releases, <span class="text-white"> 7G Rainbow Colony </span>, another Selvaraghavan film, and <span class="text-white"> Silambarasan's Manmadhan </span>, were both critically and commercially successful films, featuring acclaimed as well as popular music by Yuvan Shankar Raja, which also contributed to the films' successes. His work in the former, in particular, got critically acclaimed and eventually led him to win the <span class="text-white"> Best Music Direction Award at the 2004 Filmfare Awards South </span>; receiving the award at the <span class="text-white"> age of 25 </span>, he was the youngest winning music composer of the award at that time. For the next several years, he would have nine to ten releases every year on average, making him one of the most prolific film composers of India.<br>
            His first of nine album releases of 2005 was Raam. His score for the Ameer-directed thriller, labelled as "soul-stirring", fetched him further accolades and eventually yielded a win at the 2006 Cyprus International Film Festival for Best Musical score in a Feature Film, the first such award for an Indian composer. His successful streak continued with his following releases of that year, the low-budget films Arinthum Ariyamalum, Kanda Naal Mudhal and Sandakozhi becoming successful ventures at the box office; Yuvan Shankar's songs, "Theepidikka", "Panithuli" and "Dhavani Potta" from the respective soundtracks enjoyed popularity and were said to have played an important role in the films's successes. After the release of the soundtrack for the S. J. Suryah-starring romantic comedy Kalvanin Kadhali, that also enjoyed popularity after the film's release, his final album of 2005, Pudhupettai, released, which saw him once again collaborating with director Selvaraghavan. The ten-track experimental album, receiving high critical acclaim, was considered Yuvan Shankar Raja's finest work till then and a "musical masterpiece". The soundtrack and score of the film featured a traditional orchestral score played by the "Chapraya Symphony" of Bangkok, for the first time in a Tamil film. Critics felt that this project, in particular, proved his abilities and talent to produce innovative and experimental scores as well. The film itself, releasing only in May 2006, did average business, despite opening to outstanding reviews.</p>
          <h4 class="ps-2"  style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color: rgb(76, 150, 190);font-weight: 400;">2021 to present</h4>
          <p class="text-secondary ps-4">In 2021, he had seven releases namely <span class="text-white"> Koozhangal, Kalathil Santhippom, Chakra, Nenjam Marappathillai, Dikkiloona, Maanaadu </span>, and <span class="text-white"> Plan Panni Pannanum </span>.
            Yuvan had ten album releases in 2022. He collaborated with <span class="text-white"> Pradeep Ranganathan </span> for the 1st time in <span class="text-white"> Love Today </span>, which received a huge response from audience and positive mention from critics. <span class="text-white"> Viruman, Naane Varuvean, 1945, Veeramae Vaagai Soodum, Coffee with Kadhal, Agent Kannayiram and Laththi </span> released in 2022.
            In 2023, <span class="text-white"> Custody </span> released. He composed music for Amazon web-series <span class="text-white"> Modern Love Chennai </span>.
            He will compose music for <span class="text-white"> The Greatest of All Time </span> directed by <span class="text-white"> Venkat Prabhu </span>, which will release in 2024.</p>
          <h4 class="ps-2"  style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color: rgb(76, 150, 190);font-weight: 400;">Other languges</h4>
          <p class="text-secondary ps-4 pb-1 mb-0">Besides <span class="text-white"> Tamil films </span>, he has also scored music for films in other <span class="text-white"> South Indian languages </span>. Around 35 of the Tamil films, for which he had composed music, were afterwards dubbed into <span class="text-white"> Telugu, Kannada or Malayalam languages </span> as were the respective soundtracks. Apart from these ones, he also worked "straightly" on Telugu projects such as <span class="text-white"> Seshu, Malli Malli Chudali, Happy, Raam, Raju Bhai </span> and <span class="text-white"> Aadavari Matalaku Arthale Verule </span> and <span class="text-white"> Oy! </span>, making him a well-known popular composer in <span class="text-white"> Andhra Pradesh </span>, also. He also worked on the soundtrack for <span class="text-white"> Panjaa </span>. Yuvan's <span class="text-white"> Oxygen </span>, was released in 2017.</p>

              <p class="text-secondary ps-4 pt-3 mb-0">He has explored various genres, and experimented with new sounds. Yuvan Shankar Raja has not learnt <span class="text-white"> Indian classical music </span>, although he has used complex swara patterns and <span class="text-white"> carnatic rāgas </span> in several films, including Nandha and Thulluvadho Ilamai. Critics have noted that Yuvan Shankar Raja's music has a "youthful character to it", with his compositions in particular appealing to the younger generation.<br>
                Yuvan Shankar Raja started the <span class="text-white"> "era of remixes" </span>; <span class="text-white"> "Aasai Nooru Vagai" </span> from Kurumbu (2004) is considered as the first remix in a Tamil film, following which several composers began remixing Tamil film songs from the 1970s and 80s. He has experimented with the fusion of old songs with his own original compositions, mixing and incorporating parts of them into his songs, e.g., "Theepidikka" from Arinthum Ariyamalum (2005) and "Enga Area" from Pudhupettai (2005). In 2010, he and his friend and fellow actor Silambarasan released the song "Evan Di Unna Pethan" from the film Vaanam (2011) as a single, which generated the trend of releasing single tracks from film soundtracks in Tamil cinema several months prior to the actual release, although the first single in Tamil cinema had been released in 2001 already.<br>
                Besides scoring, Yuvan Shankar Raja is a noted playback singer as well. As of August 2011, he has sung over 80 songs, mostly his own compositions, and several times he recorded for his father Ilaiyaraaja and his brother Karthik Raja. He lent his voice first in 1988, when he was eight years old for a song in the film En Bommukutty Ammavukku, composed by his father. Since then, he frequently sang for his father in films such as Anjali (1990), Chatriyan (1990), Thalattu Ketkuthamma (1991), Friends (2001), Kaathal Jaathi (2002), Ramana (2003) and Neethane En Ponvasantham (2012). Under his brother's direction, he had sung in the films Naam Iruvar Namakku Iruvar (1998), Ullam Kollai Poguthae (2001) and Veyilodu Vilayadu (2012). He had also performed a song for the film Siddu +2 (2010), composed by his friend Dharan, and had lent his voice for the theme song for the World Classical Tamil Conference 2010, set to tune by A. R. Rahman. In 2013, he sang a song for Rahman in the film Maryan.</p>

              In January 2009, Yuvan had announced his first live performance, which was planned to be held at the <span class="text-white"> Rogers Centre </span> in <span class="text-white"> Toronto </span>, Canada on 25 April 2009. According to Yuvan, the show would have featured around 30 songs, sung by well-known singers and his father Ilaiyaraaja, as well as some stage dances in between, by actresses <span class="text-white"> Sana Khan </span> and <span class="text-white"> Meenakshi </span>. However, the concert had been postponed eventually, with Yuvan Shankar stating that he was working on novel ideas to make the show memorable and hence, postponed the concert. In October 2009, he announced that a <span class="text-white"> world tour </span>, titled <span class="text-white"> "Oru Naalil" </span>, is planned with a three-hour <span class="text-white"> stage show </span> to be held in various cities all over the world.

Also, it was planned to conduct the shows in <span class="text-white"> Muscat, Oman </span> and <span class="text-white"> Kuwait </span>, but following the Dubai concert, the tour was cancelled.<br>
              In October 2010, Yuvan Shankar Raja disclosed that he had signed for his <span class="text-white"> first live concert </span> in Chennai. The event, named <span class="text-white"> Yuvan – Live in Concert </span>, which was sponsored, organized and later telecasted on <span class="text-white"> STAR Vijay </span>, was held at the YMCA Grounds, <span class="text-white"> Nandanam </span>, Chennai, on <span class="text-white"> 16 January 2011 </span>. Additionally, a promotional music video, <span class="text-white"> "I'll Be There for You" </span>, composed and sung by Yuvan Shankar himself, directed by Vishnuvardhan and shot by <span class="text-white"> Nirav Shah </span> was made, while STAR Vijay aired a 3-week, 14 episode serial on Yuvan Shankar Raja as a run-up to the concert.<br>
              On 16 February 2012, <span class="text-white"> Techofes </span> organized a live-in tribute concert for Yuvan Shankar Raja, where he also performed.<br>
